Hello World
===========

I started coding at the age of 12 when I discovered **QBasic** and since then I haven't really stopped doing it nor do I want to. My dad had just told me how to run some games in our **Intel 286** computer which was already getting obsolete.

I had to open the source code of the game, compile it and run it on the go. For days I was just playing but then I started messing around with the code and found out I could do whatever I wanted. I cheated, a lot. 

Anyways, that was back in 1995, now I call myself an **Information Technology Engineer** or so it says in my degree. I graduated from [Andres Bello Catholic University][2] in Caracas, Venezuela.
