I started coding at the age of 12 when I discovered **QBasic** and since then I haven't really stopped doing it. My dad had just told me how to run some games in our computer which was already getting obsolete.

<!-- more -->

I had to open the source code of the game, compile it and run it on the go. For days I was just playing but then I started messing around with the code and found out I could do whatever I wanted.

Anyway, that was back in 1995, now I have a degree in **Information Technology Engineering** from [Andres Bello Catholic University][2] in Caracas, Venezuela.

I'm a **professional software developer** with **10+ years** experience.
